## Inspiration
We have encountered frustrations to contact our university to get information while learning from home.
On a regular basis also, contacting school offices is difficult and their websites are not easy to navigate. We decided to create a solution to help fill the gap and create a better user experience for customers of our University


## What it does
Admin 2.0 assists current and prospective students with FAQs, avoid website navigation and calling the school's administrator, by directing them to the website pages that hold the answers and services they need.
